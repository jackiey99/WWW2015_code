# Replacing the Irreplaceable: Fast Algorithm for Team Member Recommendation

## Overview

The package contains the following files:
- DBLP.mat: DBLP dataset, which contains co-authorship network and skills for each author
- demo.m: a demo file showcases how to used the proposed team member replacement algorithms
- label_direct_recommend.m: The proposed TEAMREP-BASIC algorithm
- label_fast_exact.m: The proposed TEAMREP-FAST-EXACT algorithm
- label_fast_approx.m: The proposed TEAMREP-FAST-APPROX algorithm
- authorDict.txt: Authors’ name in the DBLP dataset
- conflist.txt: The 43 conference venues we use as authors’ skills


## Usage
Please refer to demo.m and comments in each file for the detailed information.
